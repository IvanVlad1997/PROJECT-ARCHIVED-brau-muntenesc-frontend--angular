themes is used whenever a site has multiple themes. For instance, the example project above includes both admin and default themes. We can therefore assume this example site is styled entirely differently for logged-in admins. Perhaps to better present and accommodate the additional features an Admin has. Some websites also offer a "night mode", where the background of the site is darker with lighter-colored text for easier reading in low-light environments. An option like this would be represented in its own theme file too.
